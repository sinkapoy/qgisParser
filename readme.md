# about
it's a tool for slicing raster layers in a qgis project. Made for creating orthoimagery datasets for SR networks.

# config

**config.json** contains all tunable parameters such as the qgis project path.

# run

    python -m qgisparser

# height data
!!! The tool uses topographic-map.com as open source data provider (I still have no access to any normal GIS db).
Don't overuse the tool because every run it loads other people's servers, which costs money.
